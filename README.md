Research Question 

Topic: Spelling proficiency in Dutch tweets

Problem statement: Casual social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and TikTok allow for a lot of spelling mistakes.

Question: Are Dutch people getting better or worse at spelling, as more people are highly educated?

Research question: Is the spelling error “kado” more or less common on Dutch Twitter in 2021 compared to 2011?

Dependent variable: Frequency (“kado” vs. “cadeau”)
Independent variable: Time (2011 vs. 2021)

Method: Looking at the graph from cbs.nl their data goes up until 2021, so I thought I would take the same year and compare it to exactly a decade ago (2011). I’m going to take a set amount of Dutch tweets from both years and I will compare the frequency of both words in % of the total amount of tweets in each year.

Significance: To see whether the notion of increasingly more Dutch people being highly educated aligns with the amount of spelling mistakes made on Dutch Twitter. This could be a possible segue into further research on the topic to improve Dutch spelling.

Hypothesis: There will be fewer mentions of “kado” in 2021 compared to 2011, since more Dutch people are highly educated compared to the years before.

Limitations: The environment of Twitter has changed a lot over the years from a formal/scientific platform to more of a casual social media platform, which could have an influence on the amount of spelling errors on the platform.
